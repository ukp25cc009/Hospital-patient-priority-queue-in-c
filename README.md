# Patient Priority Queue in C

## Description

This project is a simple **Patient Priority Queue** program written in C.

The program decides which patient should be treated next based on their priority number.

### Priority Rules

* **Priority 1** = Emergency
* **Priority 2** = Urgent
* **Priority 3** = Routine

A **smaller priority number means higher priority**. Therefore, an Emergency patient is always treated before an Urgent or Routine patient.

## Features

The program has two main functions:

1. **Add Patient**

   * Adds a patient to the queue.
   * Stores the patient's name and priority number.

2. **Treat Next Patient**

   * Finds the patient with the highest priority.
   * Displays the patient being treated.
   * Removes the patient from the queue.

## Test Case 1

The following patients are added:

| Patient | Priority |
| ------- | -------- |
| P1      | 3        |
| P2      | 1        |
| P3      | 2        |
| P4      | 1        |
| P5      | 3        |
| P6      | 2        |

### Treatment Order

```text
P2 → P4 → P3 → P6 → P1 → P5
```

The Emergency patients (priority 1) are treated first, followed by Urgent patients (priority 2), and then Routine patients (priority 3).

## Test Case 2

After treating the first three patients:

```text
P2 → P4 → P3
```

The remaining patients are:

```text
P6 → Priority 2
P1 → Priority 3
P5 → Priority 3
```

A new Emergency patient is then added:

```text
P7 → Priority 1
```

### New Treatment Order

```text
P7 → P6 → P1 → P5
```

This confirms that the new Emergency patient **P7** moves ahead of the patients who were already waiting.

## Concepts Used

* Structures in C
* Arrays
* Functions
* Priority Queue
* Searching
* Removing an element from an array
* `if` conditions
* `for` loops

## How to Compile

Using GCC:

```bash
gcc main.c -o patient_queue
```

## How to Run

On Windows:

```bash
./patient_queue
```

On Linux:

```bash
./patient_queue
```

## Conclusion

This program demonstrates how a **priority queue** can be used in a hospital system to decide which patient should be treated next.

The patient with the **lowest priority number is always selected first**, regardless of their arrival order.# Hospital-patient-priority-queue-in-c
